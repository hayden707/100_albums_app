**_Description_**

**Friday Albums** an app where users can post albums that are released especially for Bandcamp Fridays.

As of now, there is no centralized place where listeners can view a single list of new releases. My app allows users to update an open source list of new music released on Bandcamp Fridays each month, as well as the labels that are releasing the albums.

I also created a [Trello](https://trello.com/b/K74eYUEB/100-albums) board to plan my approach. I began the project by building out the backend using Mongoose, then created a front end in React.
