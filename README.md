**_Description_**

I will be building an app that creates an interactive way to experience the _Wire_'s list of "One Hundred Albums that Set the World on Fire."

Background: In 1999 the British magazine of underground and experimental music created a list of albums that "should have ignited the world's imagination - but somehow got forgotten along the way." While the list itself is a treasure trove for music fans, the list has been forgetten in its own way--it is only accessible through the Internet Archive's Way Back Machine and fan-generated lists on secondary sites like Discogs. I want to make a web app that gathers these albums together with their original write-ups in a fun, accessible way, with access to hear the music through embedded YouTube videos and links to Spotify and Apple Music where they apply.

Features of the app will include a search function, an individual page for each album, a complete list, and a "random album" feature.

**_Approach_**

To prepare for my project I have mapped out the React structure by creating a Component Hierarchy Diagram, and have visualized the information in the backend with an Entity Relationship Diagram. I've also created a [Trello](https://trello.com/b/K74eYUEB/100-albums) board to plan my approach.
