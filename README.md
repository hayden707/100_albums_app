**_Description_**

I will be creating an app where users can post albums that are released especially for Bandcamp Fridays. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the music hosting site Bandcamp has designated one Friday a month in which it waves all of its fees so that 100% of sales go directly to the artists. As of now, there is no centralized place where listeners can view a curated list of new releases. My app will allow users to update an open source list of new music released on Bandcamp Fridays each month.

**_Approach_**

To prepare for my project I have mapped out the React structure by creating a Component Hierarchy Diagram, and have visualized the information in the backend with an Entity Relationship Diagram. I've also created a [Trello](https://trello.com/b/K74eYUEB/100-albums) board to plan my approach.
